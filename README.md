# Hi there, My name is PinguinLars!
## Who am I?
My name is PinguinLars, but you can call me Pinguin üêß (or Penguin) or Lars.  
I'm a Dutch student who wants to learn how to code in Java and other languages.
I'm from the Netherlands üá≥üá± and Dutch is my first language, but I can speak English fine.

## What I am learning and what I want to learn
I'm currently learning Java and Markdown, but I do want to learn JS so that I can make websites.  
(I'm also learning German and other school stuff, but that is not coding so...)

## My favorite tools to use
- IntelliJ IDEA (I use the Ultimate version, because I'm a student ü§∑)
- Teams workflows (To create teams logs for my projects)
- GitHub (To more easily share my code with my teacher)
- Micro:bit (To use as an output port for my projects)
- Samsung Flow (To use my S21 as an input device (Mostly as a camera) for my projects)
- MS Word (I use it to make reports for my school projects, but I hate it)

## My most recent project(s)
- [PinguinLars/Anti-Boskap](https://github.com/PinguinLars/Anti-Boskap) (A WIP school project for a prototype that can detect illegal forest cutting)

## Pronouns
You can use he/him/hij/zijn, but I don't realy care that much about pronouns.

##### I use viligainte mode, every unsigned commit after 1/1/2025 I didn't make.

*I use light mode, fight me*
