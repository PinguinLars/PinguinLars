# Hi there, My name is PinguinLars!
## Who am I?
My name is PinguinLars, but you can call me Pinguin üêß (or Penguin) or Lars.
(It is Dutch with missing grammar, not German)
I'm a Dutch student who wants to learn how to code in Java and other languages.
I'm from the Netherlands üá≥üá± and Dutch is my first language, but I can speak English fine.

## What I am learning and what I want to learn
I'm currently learning Java and Markdown, but I do want to learn JS so that I can make websites.  
(I'm also learning German and other school stuff, but that is not coding so...)

## My favorite tools to use
- IntelliJ IDEA (I use the Ultimate version because I'm a student ü§∑)
- Teams workflows (To create teams logs for my projects)
- GitHub (To more easily share my code with my teacher)
- Micro:bit (To use as an output port for my projects)
- Samsung Flow (To use my S21 as an input device (Mostly as a camera) for my projects)
- Pandoc (I use it to make reports for my school projects in Markdown and then covert it to word, because I hate MS Word)

## Language I use
- Java (My most used language, it is the language I can program the best)
- Markdown (I use this language for most of my docs)
- Mermaid (I use this to make graphs and flow charts)
- JavaScript (I use this language to program micro:bits with pxt(Technically it uses TypeScript ü§∑))
- Pyton (I use this Language to make macros)

## My most recent project(s)
- [PinguinLars/Anti-Boskap](https://github.com/PinguinLars/Anti-Boskap) (A school project for a prototype that can detect illegal forest cutting, it's mostly finished)
- [PinguinLars/CuteControllerTerminal](https://github.com/PinguinLars/CuteControllerTerminal) (A personal project to learn serial programming and control my self-programmed microbit rc car from my laptop)

## Pronouns
You can use he/him/hij/zijn, but I don't really care that much about pronouns.

##### I use vigilante mode, every unverified commit after 1/1/2025 I didn't make, just forgot to sign or my IDE unchecked the box.

*I use light mode, fight me* <!-- no button :( -->
