## Who am I?
My name is PinguinLars, but you can call me Pinguin (or Penguin) or Lars.  
I'm a student who wants to learn how to code in Java and other languages.
I'm Dutch and that is my first language, but I can speak English fine.

## My goals
I want to learn Java, but also other things like how to make a website or how to make an app.
