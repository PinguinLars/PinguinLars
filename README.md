<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>My name is PinguinLars, but you can call me Pinguin üêß (or Penguin) or Lars.
(It is Dutch with missing grammar, not German)
I'm a Dutch student who wants to learn how to code in Java and other languages.
I'm from the Netherlands üá≥üá± and Dutch is my first language, but I can speak English fine.</p>
<h2>What I am learning and what I want to learn</h2>
<p>I'm currently learning Java and Markdown, but I do want to learn JS so that I can make websites.
(I'm also learning German and other school stuff, but that is not coding so...)</p>
